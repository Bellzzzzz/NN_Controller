# Adaptive Sliding Mode Control using RBF Neural Network for Dynamic Systems

This repository contains MATLAB implementation of Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC) for dynamic systems using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network, as proposed in the paper *Adaptive sliding mode control of dynamic system using RBF
neural network*.

## Overview

Adaptive Sliding Mode Control is a robust control technique used to ensure stability and tracking performance for uncertain dynamic systems. This repository provides MATLAB scripts and functions that implement ASMC enhanced with an RBF neural network to handle uncertainties and disturbances in real-world applications.
